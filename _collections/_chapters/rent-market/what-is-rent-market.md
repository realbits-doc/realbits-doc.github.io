### Rent Market

Rent Market is a smart contract that enables users to register NFT or rent NFT. When a user registers NFT, registration data is also recorded, such as rent fee or rent duration. Likewise, when someone rents NFT, rent-metadata will be recorded, such as the rent fee and who is the owner and who is the renter of NFT. Upon termination of the rent, the rent fee will be shared among the NFT owner, the service owner, and the market owner. Distribution would be handled by calling the settlement function in a smart contract, which can be run by anyone with a gas fee. All rent-related data is stored in smart contracts that anyone can access. If you have a balance in the rental market, you can withdraw your fee.
