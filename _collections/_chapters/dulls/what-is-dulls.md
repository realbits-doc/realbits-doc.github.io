### Dulls

Dulls is a NFT project with a 3D avatar model. Dulls has an image and a VRM 3D model in its metadata. Users or services can use that 3D file as content. For example, an avatar chat service can utilize NFT as an avatar model. The VRM model is used as a character in online games services. For various kinds of avatar models, Dulls assembles parts of a blender file into one VRM model. For long-term compatibility, more 3D formats will be added to Dulls NFT and other metadata will be updated consistently.
