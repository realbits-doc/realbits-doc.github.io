### Whatsprompt

Whatsprompt is an online service for creating images with prompts and sharing those images with people. The user can generate and draw images with prompt text via the Discord chatbot. Then, if desired, the result can be produced as NFT with encrypted prompt data. Whether minting is done or not, every image generated by the discord chatbot will be listed on the whatsprompt service site. A minting image would not display the prompt to the user. When the user wants to see the prompt, he will have to pay a token and see the prompt for a limited time (perhaps one day). When prompt duration ends, prompt fee will be shared with NFT owner, whatsprompt service owner, and prompt market owner by smart contract.
